I'm a second-year master's student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Media and Communication (SMC, SJTU), advised by [Prof. Yi Mou](https://cfmhmc.github.io/yimou.github.io/). I’m also a [Center for Future Media & Human-Machine Communication](https://cfmhmc.github.io/) member. Tanya is my English name from my favorite Singaporean singer. You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV_JunyiChen250519).

I mainly focus on **human-machine communication** and I am interested in **socio-political and technological factors in health, scientific and risk issues**. I would love to chat and collaborate if you are interested in any aspect of me. Please email me at - jy.chen@sjtu.edu.cn.

Hi，我是上海交通大学媒体与传播学院的研二学生，导师是[牟怡](https://cfmhmc.github.io/yimou.github.io/)教授。我同时是未来媒体与人机传播实验室的一员。我主要关注人机传播，并对健康、科学、风险议题中的社会政治与技术因素有着浓厚兴趣。欢迎联系我！

Education
======
- M.A. in Communication, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2023-2026
- B.A. in Journalism, Nanjing University, 2019-2023

* Certificate of human-machine communication, Social Media Lab, Stanford University, 2022 (online due to the pandemic)
* Exchange Student, Institute of Communication Studies, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan

I grew up with endless tests under the Chinese college entrance exam system, was admitted to Nanjing University (NJU), and enrolled in the [School of Journalism and Communication](https://jc.nju.edu.cn/). For a while, I thought that my life would be spent as a conformist: reading the magnum opus of thinkers like Marx or Heidegger during schooling, actively engaging in various informal relationships, and finally graduating to a little reporter writing news about irrelevance and all the social hoopla all day long. But I kind of just felt meh. I yearned to something between macro-theory and news interviews and yearned to explore the empirical impact of digital media on human society. 

And that's when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the instant I first conducted a preliminary survey about the role of digital platforms in the exacerbation of intergroup conflicts. Since then, I can't get enough. I realized that my interests were more in technology frontiers and sought more research opportunities. Fortunately, I successfully applied for an exchange at [Stanford's Social Media Lab](https://sml.stanford.edu/). It's online due to the lockdown policy during COVID-19. Furthermore, I joined the [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://chengjun.github.io/socrateslab/), led by [ChengJun-Wang](https://chengjunwang.com/), in the School of Journalism and Communication at Nanjing University. I completed my graduation thesis on social acceleration and time use there.

Now I am continuing my studies and research in journalism and communication at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am preparing to apply for the PhD program in Communication in 2026.

Research Interest
======
My research interests are broad, focusing primarily on **human-computer communication** and **socio-political factors in new media**. These two seemingly distant fields of study are inextricably linked to my learning and growing experience.

Experience
------
- The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown policy coincided with a period of significant personal growth and development for me. This period also saw me becoming increasingly exposed to a vast amount of health, science, and policy-related information shared on social media. I observed that public attitudes toward this information remain highly polarized even in a one-party society like China. Despite the current lack of academic and social interest in COVID-19 and relevant policies in China, I remain interested in the public's understanding of science. I also focus on socio-political and technological factors in health, science and risk issues.
- As a little “geek”, I am deeply impressed by the impact of AI technology on established societal norms. As an “AI immigrant”, I am witnessing its gradual integration into society. will result in a significant global social revolution. I aim to explore the socio-psychological impacts of human-AI communication, including intimacy, trust, and credibility at the individual level, and digital inequality and social polarization at the societal level.

Topics
------
Specifically, the research topics I am interested in include:
1. Human-computer interaction
2. AIGC and effects
3. Socio-political factors in health, scientific, environmental and risk issues
4. Public opinion
