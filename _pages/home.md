I mainly focus on <span class="my-name">human-machine communication</span> and I am interested in <span class="my-name">socio-political and technological factors in health, scientific and risk issues</span>.

## Research Interest
My research interests are broad, focusing primarily on human-machine communication and socio-political factors in SHER issues. These two seemingly distant fields of study are inextricably linked to my learning and growing experience.

### Topics
Specifically, the research topics I am interested in include:
1. AIGC and effects
2. Belief in conspiracy theories
4. Information strategy
5. Public opinion
