I caught fire exploring. 

I grew up with endless tests under the Chinese college entrance exam system, was admitted to Nanjing University (NJU), and enrolled in the [School of Journalism and Communication](https://jc.nju.edu.cn/). For a while, I thought that my life would be spent as a conformist: reading the magnum opus of thinkers like Marx or Heidegger during schooling, actively engaging in various informal relationships, and finally graduating to a little reporter writing news about irrelevance and all the social hoopla all day long. But I kind of just felt meh. I yearned to something between macro-theory and news interviews and yearned to explore the empirical impact of digital media on human society. 

And that's when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the instant I first conducted a preliminary survey about the role of digital platforms in the exacerbation of intergroup conflicts. Since then, I can't get enough. I realized that my interests were more in technology frontiers and sought more research opportunities. Fortunately, I successfully applied for an exchange at [Stanford's Social Media Lab](https://sml.stanford.edu/). It's online due to the lockdown policy during COVID-19. Furthermore, I joined the [Computational Communication Collaboratory](https://chengjun.github.io/socrateslab/), led by [ChengJun-Wang](https://chengjunwang.com/), in the School of Journalism and Communication at Nanjing University. I completed my graduation thesis on social acceleration and time use there.


My Research Interests
------
- The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown policy coincided with a period of significant personal growth and development for me. This period also saw me becoming increasingly exposed to a vast amount of health, science, and policy-related information shared on social media. I observed that public attitudes toward this information remain highly polarized even in a one-party society like China. Despite the current lack of academic and social interest in COVID-19 and relevant policies in China, I remain interested in the public's understanding of science. I also focus on socio-political and technological factors in health, science and risk issues.
- As a little “geek”, I am deeply impressed by the impact of AI technology on established societal norms. As an “AI immigrant”, I am witnessing its gradual integration into society. will result in a significant global social revolution. I aim to explore the socio-psychological impacts of human-AI communication, including intimacy, trust, and credibility at the individual level, and digital inequality and social polarization at the societal level.

Now I am continuing my studies and research in journalism and communication at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I am preparing to apply for the PhD program in Communication in 2026.
